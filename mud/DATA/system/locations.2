with high columned arches surrounding it. Thick heavily tangled bushes grow all
around the stumps of the many fallen pillars, frequently hiding them from view.
The ruins extend back westwards, but to the south and east have been covered

The sea now breaks over the low crumbling stone wall which must once have been
a jetty of some sort.  Thick tangled bushes extend north and east following the

thick vegetation.
