	Said Ged, "I do not know, for the interconnections of its
		   chambers are most intricate.  Perhaps we should ask
		   Tedd, the Zen Master of Aber."
	So they did.
	Said Ged, "Oh wise and most learned Tedd, how can one find one's
		   way through the treacherous maze of the catacombs?"
	Said Tedd, "One can't.  Send Ned."
	And suddenly Cedric and Ged were most pleased, for Tedd had
	shown them the path to enlightenment.

book <null> 0 200 0 10
A heavy iron bound book has been left here.^
^
^
^
The book details many arcane and powerful magics, mostly to cause severe
pain to other beings.  In a flowing hand is written:
  
Fireball
        A potent piece of magic much dependant upon the power of the caster
        as to the damage it does, although sulphur enhances this.
Missile
        A similar magic, much popular amongst mages.  It is said that magical
        talismans may be created to aid this spell.
Shock
        A spell of touch, which can pass through metal armors with great ease.
        A decent caster never uses this as a party trick.
        Lodestones help with its casting.
Frost
	While not so powerful as a fireball, a direct hit will slow
	your opponent down and make his aim less sure.  It is said that
	wintergreen will enhance this spell.
  
Any mage should beware that casting magic, though potent, will drain the 
strength of the caster.

	1) No summoning people to kill them.  If you do this, you will
	   be banned from the world.
	2) No complaining to the witches or wizards if you die in the 
	   Arena.  Consider yourself warned.  You will not have your
	   points restored, and you may be zapped if you complain.
	3) Anyone in the Arena is fair game.  Player killing will not
	   be tolerated outside of the Arena, period.

The note reads:
	Dear Mr. Manager:
		I am sorry to have to trouble you at a time when you must
	be so very busy, renewing important engagements, signing fresh ones
	and generally displaying your excellent taste.  I know what you
	have done for Carlotta and for a few others whose admirable
	qualities of talent or genius you have suspected.  Of course when I
	use these words, I do not mean to apply them to La Carlotta, who
	sings like a squirt and who ought never to have been allowed to
	leave the Cafe Jacquine.  And I am not speaking of Christine Daae
	either, though her genius is certain, whereas your jealousy prevents
	her from creating any important part.  All the same I should like
	to take advantage of the fact that you have not yet turned her out
	of doors by hearing her this evening.  I will watch the performance
	from my normal seat in Box 5, which will be kept empty for me.
	Should these commands be ignored, a disaster beyond your
	imagination will occur.
				Your Most Humble and Obedient Servant,
				Opera Ghost

The journal seems to belong to Dinthiar, the elven king.  It speaks of what
has happened to this once beautiful land.  It seems that there were two
great evils, who had been engaged in an eternal war with each other.  They
had shifted from world to world, leaving each one a desolate ruin behind
them.  Sadly, one day the two evils came down upon this beautiful realm.
Here, their last battle was fought.  One of the two, a demon of great power,
still resides in the caves to the west, lording over the land he helped
destroy.  The other, a deathless lich, was forced to flee.  It is rumored
though, that he still hides somewhere in these lands.  Dinthiar believes
that the elven lands can still be restored.  What is needed is a great hero
to vanquish the two ancient evils...
