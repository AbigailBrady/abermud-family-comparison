The Crypt^
   You are in a small room, standing before the entrance to a vast and ancient
crypt.  Low moaning sounds echo from within the catacombs before you, sending
chills up your spine.
   An archway, its keystone carved in the shape of a human skull, leads south
into darkness, while cool air blows in from the relative safety of the church
above.

regular intervals are deep recesses, within which lie the stone tombs of a
generation long since departed.  A gentle breeze blows in from the passage to
the north, while dark hallways lead south, east, and west.
   A spiral staircase fills one corner of the room.

   The large room hung completely in black with an enormous stave of
music containing the notes of the Dies Irae many times repeated.  Off
to one side of the room there is a canopy, from which hangs curtains
of red brocaded material, and, under the canopy, an open coffin.  An
enormous organ covers one entire wall.  Against the far wall is a dais,
upon which sits a black throne.

The Torture Chamber^
   You have fallen into a hexoganal room made of mirrors.  In one
corner stands an iron tree with one branch, from which hangs a noose.
In the bright light, the tree is reflected into a huge forest.  As the
room is slowly heated up, you begin to hallucinate that you are in an
African forest.  The room continues to get hotter until you either are 
roasted alive, or, unable to take the torture any longer, hang yourself
on the iron tree.
