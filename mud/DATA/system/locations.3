Ged's Study^
The study is clearly a place where many a great thought has seen
birth, for in this room have sat the great wizards Robocop, Krid,
Rassilon and others, as well as the room's keeper, Ged the Arch-Mage.
You stand by an old oak desk on which sits a candle, slowly burning
itself down.  Across the room is a large window opening onto a balcony.
The balcony offers a splendid view of the night sky.  On one wall of
the room are hung a series of small paintings of Ged's old friends,
as well as a small golden cross, a gift from Ged's first pupil,
Eladan the Warrior-Priest.  By the other wall are a couch and a chair.
You feel very comfortable in this room.  It is a place where you can
sit and chat, or, if you feel so inclined, to talk about the many great
and beautiful things to be found in this life, and in this universe.

faint distant echoes of your own heartbeat.  All about you you sense the
slow majestic forces that shape the very world.  Everything about this room
seems to focus toward a small alcove in one wall, as if its contents were
worthy of reverence even by the inanimate rock.  There are passageways that
lead east and west, but if you choose to leave, you will probably be unable

Sacred Clearing^
   You find yourself in a clearing deep in the Misty Mountains.  Some mighty
being has carved this niche out of the living rock, making a place suitable for
the gods themselves to wed.  A simple podium in the center of this clearing
lends to the overall impression that this is a holy place.
   Stands have been hewn out of the mountain and intricately carved with an
animal motif.  Each of the 50 seats depicts a different creature, and all
appear calm and serene.
   A feeling of peace and goodwill washes over you as you gaze in awe at the
majestic peaks that surround this place.

shimmers ominously with the intense heat of the dry air. To the horizon in all
directions you see only desert.  The oasis is sparsely populated by palm trees,
offering cool shade beside a sparking fountain of water.  The water trickles
down the rocks with a pleasant gurgling sound. The sunlight makes it glitter.
This place would be welcomed as a miracle by any weary traveller lost in the
desert. You get an eerie sense that the whole thing might be a trick of lights,
and you half expect it to fade from site if you inspect anything closely...

saying "Welcome to the Greystreak's Home away from reality".  The room
is set up with a nice couch in one corner for visitors to get comfortable
on and in the other corner there is a computer desk with a NeXT cube sitting
on it.  There are papers strewn everywhere.  The place looks like work is
actually being done here.  On the north wall there is a quaint and very
romantic fireplaace with a warm blazing fire.  As you look closer at the fire
you notice its fuel source is a Calculus book.  ----------<-------<@

you see a lot of impressive and extremely confusing equipment, most of which
you don't even begin to recognize...  there are large silver bars with warning
signs on them, a bank of levers, dials, and switches labelled things like "aft
port retrorockets", and a half-dozen boxes filled with what look like spare
parts.  A small corner is given to personal effects, mostly holographs of
Kinnison's friends, and one very old-looking photograph of a wedding.  You
recognize Ged, who seems to have performed the ceremony, and the inscription
on the frame reads:
                     Kemenel and Mirage -- June 28, 1990

training room of one of the Knights of Abermud.  There are several ragged
looking practise dummies, assorted shields and clubs, a rapier and a
claymore, but the prize of the weapon collection is a long silver sword
resting on a pedestal on the mantlepiece.  The sword bears no inscription,
and the hilt is plain brown leather.  The only adornment is a clear purple
stone set in the hilt.  Displayed proudly above the sword is Eladan's most
prized trophy, the head of the Great Dragon of Abermud, with the date August
6, 1990 inscribed on the plaque.  There are two statuettes standing in
opposite corners of the room, apparently gazing at the activities therein.
One is of Eladan's master Ged, and the other is of their Lord Rassilon.

mainly concerning dragons and the workings of the mind.  A window peeks out
onto low rolling hills covered in a light snow, and you see several hobbits
poking their heads out small round doors.  A small picture of a golden dragon
hangs on the wall.

wall that reads 'Smoking is not permitted under ANY circumstances.'
   In the back of the room, you see a rather large. metallic structure.  A
tag identifies this as the Holmes IV computer.  Lights flicker about it.
   On the far wall is a large screen; it is currently blank.  A sign below
it reads 'Adam Selene was here.'
   To the front of the room there is a large counter with various electronic
equipment on it.  The area looks a mess, as if no one ever cleans up after
themselves.
   The room is quiet, except for the soft humming of a cooling fan.

The Stairs^
   You are climbing a set of steep, slippery stairs that lead up into the
church tower.  Water runs down the steps, collecting in mossy pools, where the
cracks and dips in the stonework allow it.  The steps turn from stone to wood
up above, and look very rickety.
   To the west a doorway leads out into the pulpit.

    The heaviness and darkness of this grave is so prevalent that even during
the middle of the day you need a light to see.  The mound here is overgrown
with weeds and the tombstone is old and uncared for.  The stone, although
aged and cracked, is readable, and says:

  Do you know that it hurts?       Yet this is their reward?
    Do you feel my pain?             Tied up in anguish?
  Can you understand my meaning,   What example is this,
    My reason for what I do?         That they do not understand?

Olive Tree^
   In this tree there is a kind of hanging bookcase, sheltered somewhat from
the rains.  The olive grove continues to the north.

Olive Tree^
   This tree juts out from a cliff, and through the leaves and branches you
find the sea there facing you, calm and limpid and vast as the sky. The horizon
opens wide and high and the sea-blue is stretched bare, without a sail. You can
almost count the far-off ripples of the waves.  Only a very light rustle, like
a sigh, runs over the pebbles on the beach.

Walnut Tree^
   You are in an old and stately nut tree.  At the fork of the trunk is a
hollow, formed from an old ax wound.  A soft boarskin is stretched across the
hollow, making a cosy refuge in the shade of the dark green foliage.  In a deep
incision in the bark, now so old and deformed that it no longer seems the work
of human hands, is carved in big letters: Cosimo, Viola, and beneath: Ottimo
Massimo.

Fox Hole^
   You have crawled into a damp, narrow fox hole.  The roots of the giant oak
are all around you.  The burrow continues to the south, but the fox smell is
stronger there.

Fox Burrow^
   You are crawling around on your hands and knees in a cramped north-south fox
burrow.  The stench of fox permeates the burrow and gets even stronger towards
the south.  The air to the north is somewhat fresher.

Fox Den^
   You are wedged into a reeking fox den.  Strangely enough, the vixen has
built her den adjoining a huge natural cavern that extends deep into the earth,
much farther than your feeble flame can penetrate.  It looks like it might go
all the way to China!  You could jump in, but you would fall a long way....
There is a blinking construction sign here.
