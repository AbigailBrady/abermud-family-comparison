The Elven Forest^
   You stand at the entrance of what was once a grand elven forest.  Now, it
lies in ruins about you.  Blackened stumps abound and the trees which still
stand reek of decay.  This secluded vale has obviously been destroyed by some
great disaster.  You are overcome by a sense of foreboding! The evil which
ruined this forest may still be around!
   Although deeply disturbed by the destruction around you, you manage to look
about to determine your position.  To the North and East are the mountains
which shield this valley.  The area to the South of you also heads into
mountains, but a path makes passage possible.  An archway marks a tunnel
through the eastern mountains.

Forest Home^
   You have entered a small forested area of great beauty, in sharp contrast
to the destruction to the south.  About you, the sounds of nature abound.  If
not for the memory of the tainted forest to the south, you could become easily
lost in the beauty here.  Just to the East of you, partially hidden by healthy
trees, is a small cottage.  To the North and West are the mountains which
seclude this valley.

   You have entered the home of Dinthiar, the Elven King.  It is a rather
simple dwelling.  A bed, table and chair are the only furnishings.  However,
the whole room is given a 'foresty' feel by the ivy which grows up the insides
of the walls, and by the potted plants which hang from the ceiling.  It is
exactly the type of dwelling that you would expect an elf to have.

Forest Path^
   You are walking down a forest path which seems less corrupted than the
surrounding areas.  Some wildlife still lives, and the trees are not rotting or
dead.  You see some of the beauty which once existed in this realm.  To the
north of you lies more vibrant forest, while to the south you see only
destruction.

   You are in a small clearing in the ruins of the elven forest.  The ground in
this clearing is blackened and infertile.  It is obvious that nothing will grow
here for a long time.  The only sign of life here is a circle of toadstools
which lies near the center of the glade.  All around you is ruined forest.
Just to the North, however, you think that you see some greenery.

   You have wandered into a small glen which is grotesquely warped.  Trees
form weird, diabolical shapes, and the area seems pervaded by the stench of
brimstone.  You gag to avoid breathing the fouled air.  To the North and West
are the mountains which shield this valley.  It is quite unfortunate that they
did no protect the forest from whatever destroyed it...

Blackened Oaks^
   Your heart skips a beat as you enter this grove of trees.  Without a doubt,
this grove used to contain some of the strongest and most beautiful trees in
the entire elven forest.  Now, it looks as though a giant hand came down from
the heavens, and simply pushed the trees down, in a line from West to East.
The few Oaks which still stand have been warped into unhealthy shapes, which
nature itself could never produce.  Following the line of downed trees, you
realize that it leads to a freshly hewn pathway in the mountains to the West.

Shattered Forest^
   You cry out in horror as you witness what has been done to this forest.  All
about, trees lie downed, as if hewn by some giant axe.  However, even the
twisted corpses of the trees seem unnatural.  Somehow, a single oak tree in
the center of the swath of destruction seems to have survived.  It lies just
to the east of you.  To the west, the line of destruction seems to continue.
Mercifully, mountains to the east protected any further realms from this
corruption.

Inside the Grand Oak^
   You gasp out in awe at the quiet beauty of this hidden hollow.  The
entire room draws your eyes upwards, like some ancient gothic cathedral.
There, among the arched, wooden roof, are numerous tiny flowers, hanging 
from the vines which grow around you. Even in the dim light, the brilliant 
hues of the flowers - red, violet, blue, green, and white - stand out. 
Indeed, they glow with their own light, providing the majority of the 
illumination in this room and sending incredible, multi-colored shadows 
around the room. As you stare at them, something tugs at your memory. You 
have seen that pattern somewhere before... it is the pattern of the stars 
in the night sky, but of a color and brightness that the night sky can only 
hint at.
   Once, the whole elven forest must have been like this...

sickly green glow which speaks of evil, pestilence and disease.  You suppress
a shudder and view your surroundings.  To the south and west lie this forest's
protective mountains, while woods lie to the east.  To the North, a wide swath
of destructions cuts into the heart of this realms.

forest.  Now, you can only see the destruction.  To the North and West,
you gaze out at the corrupted, desolate land which was once so beautiful.
Amid the destruction, you see a few points of life.  Just to the Northeast
of you stands a tall, healthy oak tree, while further to the North, you
actually think you see green.  The mountain trail you are on continues North
and South, while a small path leads up from the forest to the West.

ground is cracked and dying, and the only vegetation is a thorny brush, which
practically cover the path, ripping at your clothes.  The entire Eastern cliff
is covered by a wall of thorns.  On the other side, just to the West is a
sharp dropoff.  Past it, you can see the entire elven forest.  The corrupted
view turns your stomach.

you see dark shadows flittering about.  The scent of brimstone is stronger

one of the great evils lies within this cave...

which comes to mind is 'hellish.'  The caverns glow with a strange red
glow which speaks of nothing more than hellfire.  It almost seems to you that
you can hear the screams of the damned.  A set of stairs leads downwards,
and the heat coming from below almost knocks you out.  Just to the North is
a roughly carved doorway.  Next to the door is a sign which says : Please
check in your souls before entering.

instantly zapped by some evil being.  Instead, the room seems to be a quite
simple coat room.  Lining the walls are coats of every shape and size, checked
in, no doubt, due to the heat below. You would laugh at how ridiculous this
whole scene looked if not for the evil that you feel below you.

A broken tables lies off to one corner, with the remnants of a meal, ages old
on it, and several broken chairs litter the floor.  The room itself actually
reeks of garbage, and covering the walls are a dried up substance that looks
suspiciously like blood.  A crudely letter sign on the wall reads GARD ROME.
To the South is an archway that seems to lead into a somewhat cleaner room.

a wooden pedestal which has been polished to perfection, and which is
exceedingly clean.  You have come through the only entrance to this room.

were obviously sadly mistaken.  Here, every breath you take burns your lungs.
Your skin is already beginning to blister from the intense heat, and you are
worried that your clothing may spontaneously combust!  As well, flames appear
in the corners of this room and the smell of brimstone is so strong that it
makes you want to vomit immediately.  Surely, nothing but Hades itself could
lie in the Inferno below...

the room.  A small glowing ball provides a soft light.  The Lich's office
is just to the north.

Dark Priest's Lair^
   You stand in a room which is consumed by darkness.  Shadows flicker every-
where, seeming almost alive.  For a moment, you worry that your light source
may be extinguished.  Glancing around, through the inky darkness, you realize
that you are in some type of bed room.  Evil religious icons and grotesque
paintings line the walls.  In the corner sits an altar which is covered by
a dark red liquid.  Without a doubt, this is the home of the Priest of the
dark elves.

Temple Treasury^
   You stand in the treasury of this grand dark elven temple.  This side
room is just as beautiful, in its dark, alluring way, as the main worship
room to the east.  Looking around, you are surprised to see that the treasury
is empty!  A note to the side explains that the dark elven Priest has taken
the treasures of the temple for its own 'protection.'

Inside the Temple^
   You stand just inside the temple of the dark elves.  Looking around, you
realize that it is quite beautiful, even though the beauty seems somehow evil.
You are chilled by a sense of foreboding as you think of what dark acts may
have been committed inside this place of worship, for some nameless evil god.
You see small archways out of this room to the North and West.

Dark Elf Temple^
   You have emerged into the largest subterranean cavern that you have ever
seen.  Above you, the roof lies somewhere beyond the radius of your light
source, while to the sides of this cavern, you can just barely make out the
walls.  Most astounding is a temple lying in the center of this cavern, which
has apparently been constructed entirely underground!  The temple is made out
of some type of dark stone which glows with an unholy black light.  Without
a doubt, this temple is dedicated to some dark deity.  You may enter it to the
North.  Off to the east and south lie other exits from this cavern.

temple.  It is a rather dark and dreary.  On the ground lie two worn mattresses
while a wobbly table stands to the side.

barracks to the East.  There is a neat bed here, with a tidy table next to.
If it weren't for the fact everything in this room was black, the place might
actually look cheery.

Elven Barracks^
   You are in a large barracks for the dark elf troops.  The whole place seems
run down.  Trash litters the floor and most of the beds in this room are
destroyed.  It looks as if, for the most part, the dark elves do not bother
to maintain an army now that their enemies, the good elves above, are gone.
Exits leave these barracks to the West and East.

Cavern of the Dark Elves^
   You have entered an enormous cavern.  You are awed by the vastness of this
room.  As you acclimate to this dark, damp environment, you remember of the
ancient legends you have heard of a dark race of elves living below the
surface.  Surely, this is their realm!  Looking around you, this assumption
is upheld by the many dark shapes you see moving in the shadows.  You should
move through these realms quickly.  Surely the dark shapes would overwhelm
you by numbers if you stayed here too long.  Exits leave this cavern to the
North, West, South and East, while a ladder leads up.

Glowing Passage^
   You walk down a passage which curves to the West and South.  The passage
is lit by an eerie green glow which seems to come from fungus growth on the
walls.  Ever once in a while, you think you see a dark shape at the edge of
your vision, but then it could just be your imagination.

Besides mushrooms and other common fungus, you also see many unusual ones,
much as in the fungus cavern above.  As well, the green fungus from the
the passageway to the North may be seen.

   You stand in a large room which seems to have been well kept.  It has none
of the squalor of the barracks to the North.  There is a neat bed here, as
well as an organized desk.  However, the entire room is covered by a layer of
dust. Obviously, these quarters have not been used for quite some time.  The
only exit is to the North.

constantly dripped on it.  You think you can manage to keep a grip on the
ladder which extends far above and below you.

On the Deck^
   You are standing on the wooden planking of the main deck of a large pirate
ship.  A mast climbs into the sky, atop of which you can see the crow's nest.
The deck leads around the ship.  North to the forward end of the ship, south
to the aft.

   You are standing on the deck at the bow end of the pirate ship.  Cannon
emplacements line the sides, and a small pile of cannon balls is beside each
cannon.  A small hatchway leads down into what is apparently the hold, and  a
small plank leads out over the ocean to the east.  Around the ship, you see
clear blue water, infested with man-eating sharks.

Ship's Hold^
   You are in the ship's hold, apparently just a rather large, open space.  It
is immediately obvious that the pirates have transported a large variety of
objects in their ship, for you see everything from scraps of cloth to animal
droppings littering the floor.  To the south, a large door leads to the rest
of the ship.

Ship's Mess^
   You are in a large room with several long tables.  Sawdust covers the floor,
and scraps of food litter both it and the tables.  Smokey light streams in 
from several portholes lining the walls, but it does nothing to lighten the
mood of the place.  A small doorway leads off to the west, a hallway extends
to the south, and a large door stands in the middle of the north wall.

kitchen.  Lining the walls are pots, pans, and other kitchen utensils.  A
small stove sits in one corner of the room, amid sacks of flour, sugar, and
pepper.  The only exit to the room is in the east wall.

with large knifes.  You see a small table made out of a barrel and a wooden
panel.  A doorway is in the east wall.
