Canyon View^
You are at the top of a great canyon on its west wall.  From here there is
a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream.
Across the canyon the walls of some white cliffs join the mighty ramparts
of the Flathead Mountains to the east.  Following the canyon upstream to the
north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.  The mighty Frigid
River flows out from a great dark cavern.  To the west and south can be seen
an immense forest, stretching for miles around.  A path leads west into a
thick forest.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
