Mon Jul 16 20:23:10 1990  Charles Hannum  (mudmaint at mole.ai.mit.edu)

	* exec.c: The database tables can now _nest_.  This doesn't do
	much at the moment.  It's just there for something I'm planning
	in the future.

	* database.c: Check for mail *occasionally*.  2 or 3 seconds is
	too often.

	* Use pwait() directly for the "Press <Return> to continue..."
	prompt.  The bprintf() code '^AW' has been removed.

	* Won't echo for non-ttys.  It *assumes* (possibly incorrectly)
	that a non-tty echoes remotely.  This is to avoid the double-echo
	experienced with the current socket code.  This will eventually
	be removed.

Mon Jul 16 09:48:38 1990  Brian Preble  (rassilon at mole.ai.mit.edu)

	* msghand.c (checkmail): Checks for new mail and notifies user.

	* Changed format of MSG output.
	* New actions: Kvetch, cheer, blink, nudge, pant

Changes since Jabberwock (4.98.3) version:

  I don't guarantee everything is in the list; this is all from memory, and
  everyone knows my memory is bad. -- Mycroft/Edheler

  * Addition of MUDLIST and NEWS commands

  * Addition of extra locations, objects and mobiles from dagon *except* for
    the SCICENT.  Also, a new area (the PIRATE zone) is under construction
    and is not yet connected.  The DUNGEON code, which was being worked on
    at IthilMUD before it went down, is also present and should probably be
    removed.  You might want to remove PIRATE for now; I can send the
    finished version when it's done.

  * Lots of changes to bprintf.c to speed it up; ask me if you want details.

  * setvbuf() in main(), which should speed things up by doing better I/O
    buffering.  To flush the buffer, call the (new) bflush() routine, in
    bprintf.c.

  * A couple of new bprintf() codes:

      ^ASxxx^A		Delays output for xxx seconds.  (Note that fixed delays
			over an InterNet link are really gross and should be
			removed.)

      ^AW		Displays "Press <Return> to continue..." and wait for
			said action to occur.

  * Some code has been moved to different source files; notably, such functions
    as chpwd() and delu2() have been moved to maint.c.

  * New MSG command, mostly contained in msghand.c.  (Needs to be rewritten.)

  * Support in the Makefile for moving the world_file to a different location.
    You'll want to move it to /tmp/world_file if you normally run over NFS to
    avoid killing your local net and both machines.

I have a (currently) page-long to-do list for AberMUD.  If anyone would, uh,
like to help me do some of this stuff (which would be MUCH appreciated), we
can put AberMUD behind even TinyMUD in resource utilization.

(A note:  If you don't know C, PLEASE do not try to hack on AberMUD!  It's been
hard enough trying to clean up some of the past garbage!!!)
