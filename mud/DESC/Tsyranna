Tsyranna stands before you, brave, defiant, and yet glorious, and beautiful
in a radiant splendor of sorts...a golden haze filters through silken strands
of her hair, as you become transfixed by a ubiquitous prescence.
   Slowly, yet adamantly you manage to clear your apparently obscured 
vision and are faced with the sudden stark realization that the dazzling
figure that, only moments ago danced through the corners of your mind's eye,
has been replaced by a strangely marvelous creature of ancient design.
   Spanning some three feet between wingtips, a golden-hued dragonet
spirals in lazy circles through the air, staying aloft with light, and
graceful beats of her wings.  Noticing your inquiring stare she peers back
at you through opalescent eyes.
