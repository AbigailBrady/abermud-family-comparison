
   Ela'isajo is Hamlet's elven dog.  She is medium sized, short haired, and
brown with a stumpy tail.  In her eyes you can see a shrewed, though limited,
intelligence.  Though she is as playful as a puppy around her master, Ela
watches all others warily, and rarely is she heard to bark.  She looks like the
kind of dog who would like to lie in front of a warm fire on a cold winter's
day.
