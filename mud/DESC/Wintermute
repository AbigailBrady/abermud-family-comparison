Before you stands a man well over six feet in height.  His hair
is a deep black with quicksilver streaks running through it.  His eyes
are the palest of blue that send shivers down your spine when you stare
into them.  
He wears a white cloak that is practically blended with his skin,
he wears also a black tunic and breeches.  As well as a snow white
pair of boots.
While you may see him, he still remains a mystery.
