Greystreak stands before Bewildered as to what his descriptions
should be.  He thinks and Ponders and just remains completely 
Bewildered so he just smiles and say "gotta go dude Pensalon must 
Rise"  and then he walks of into the sunset mumbling something about
having writers block on his new continent of Pensalon.
He also leaves a dozen roses for all the fair maidens of the land
