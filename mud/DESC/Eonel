Eonel seems to be unable to keep his slight form from fidgitting.  The
bow and quivers he carries show him to be a bowman; his pointed ears,
angle eyebrows, and glowing blue eyes show him to be elven.  The
concealed stealth in his walk and the black lining of his robin-red
cloak speak of a preference for the night.  His features are scarred with
many wounds that look as though they should have been fatal, yet his
seemingly endless energy is testament to the fact that they were not.
Eonel grins evilly.
