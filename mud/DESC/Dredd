  You see a man dressed in dark leather and wearing a helmet that covers all
but his mouth.  A large badge covers his heart and read "DREDD".  At 6' 2" and
weighing 215 lbs., he is good sized, but nothing extreme.  He has journeyed
far, from Mega-City 1, to explore the rest of the world, in his quest to become
"Chief Judge of Mega-City 1".  You then recognize his uniform as that of a 
Judge.  This represents the police, judge, jury and, if needed, the executioner
of Mega-City 1.
