You see a purple mass of fuzz floating around in the air.  The fuzzball almost
looks as if it would stay in the air if the breeze were to stop.  It lacks any
sense of direction as it floats to and from.  In another world it might be
called a living kooshball whatever that is.  The fuzzball brushes against your
face and it tickles a little -- it is simply magic that this wonderful creature
exists.
