A mockery of one of nature's greatest creations stands before you.  Once it 
used to be a bear, a powerful woodland beast.  Now the bear has been twisted
and its fundamental nature corrupted by the evils of the Elven Forest.  It
walks like a rabid animal.  One eye is swollen and full of puss while the 
other one looks at you with hate.  Patches of skin can be seen on its side
where its fur has fallen out.  What fur that remains seems dull and dirty,
not bright and shiny as bear fur should be.  It seems angry for no reason,
maybe you had better stand back away from it.
