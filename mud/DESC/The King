This particular orc almost approaches impressiveness.  If he stopped slouching
he would probably reach two meters in height. His dark skin and hair are almost
clean, and he might even have taken a bath somewhere in the not-too-distant
past.  He wears a cloak of black and blood red, the royal colors.  His face is
contorted into a permanent look of anger and viciousness, and you wonder if
that blood red color on his cloak is from a dye, or some other source...
