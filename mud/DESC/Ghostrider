You see a man, dressed in white, and blue armor, which is slightly blood
stained standing before you.  He has a dark grim look on his face, as if
he has been in many battles.  He is riding on a horse, but you look closer
at the horse, and see that it isn't a horse....
It is the ghost of his last victem.  Will you be his next steed?
