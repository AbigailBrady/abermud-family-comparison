Randy obviously thinks that he's the Gods' gift to orcdom.  He walks with as
much of a stagger as is possible being stooped over that much.  He also
holds his head up quite high so that he can try to look down his oversized
nose.  The overall effect is quite ridiculous.  He seems to be angry, maybe
over the fact that some people refuse to admit that he's the most gorgeous
orc ever to exist (or so he thinks).
