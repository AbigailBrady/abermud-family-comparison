The zombie's putrid breath is the first thing you notice when you catch wind 
of him.  It smells of death and decay.  As it tries to speak bits and pieces
of its face and throat fall to the ground.  It seems to want to live the life of
an adventurer but it can't think because of the maggots you see crawling in and
out of its brain to and from its eyesockets.  You could only imagine what could
be going on inside his brain.  As a result it just wanders around aimlessly 
without purpose.
