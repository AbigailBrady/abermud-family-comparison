A tall, rather thin man stands before you.  He appears to be wearing a strange
grey cape, the fabric of which is like none other you have seen before.  In his
eyes, you can almost see the fact that he is like no other person you have
encountered before.  They seem to beckon to you to speak to him and get to know
him better.  His humour is keen, his sense for having a good time as much as
possible forever present.
