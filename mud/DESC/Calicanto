You see a man about 5'8" with brown hair, and dark brown eyes.  His face    
is deeply tanned, and shows the creases from years of wind and sun.  He 
has a pleasant appearance, but does not look overly friendly.  He carries 
an old guitar carefully wrapped up in a brown case.  He notices your gaze,
almost instantly, and nods with silent acknowledgement.
