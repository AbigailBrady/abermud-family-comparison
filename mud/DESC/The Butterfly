You see a huge, mean, vicious killer butterfly.  It can smell your fear of it.
It knows you can't run from it.  It will get you.  There is no escape.  Don't
even try it.  If you think you can attack it and win you must be a fool.  You
might tell the tale about battling it after you have died at its gnarly insect
mandibles that will tear your body to pieces.  There will be blood and guts and
bodily fluids everywhere as it tears you to pieces and eats your raw human 
flesh.  Just don't mess with it, you really don't want to die now do you?
