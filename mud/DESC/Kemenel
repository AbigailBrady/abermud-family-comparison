Kemenel is 1.8m tall, 82kg, with brown hair and a short beard.  His eyes are
the color of sea foam on an overcast autumn day, and seem to glow slightly.
He wears a thin wire bound about his head with a small gem attached.  Oddly,
the gem seems to emit, rather than reflect, light...  he also wears a ring
of blended gold and silver on his left hand, shimmering in the sun.
