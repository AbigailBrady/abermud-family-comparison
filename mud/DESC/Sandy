Sandy is very short, even for a stooped-over orc.  She stands at most 115 cm
tall.  This is probably a good thing, because she is so ugly that the less
there is of her the better.  Unlike the other orcs, she actually looks like she
might actually like to try kissing a human, but death would probably be quite
preferable.
