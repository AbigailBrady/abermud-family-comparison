    Out of the shadows steps a lean, dark-robed figure about 7'0" tall. On
his back rests a hooded cloak of the most infinite whiteness, broken only
by flowing patches of darkness which seem to move and shift with a life of
their own. At his side is a mage's staff trimmed in gold leaf and encrypted
with ancient ruins, with a brilliant lapis lazuli gem resting in the crux near
the top.
    His face is masked in shadow, making it impossible to distinguish any
facial fetures below; only when he trusts some one will he then remove the
haunting mask. His eyes burn with a firey redness that pierces your soul,
making you quite uneasy standing here. While turning to leave, you hear the
flapping of wings and turn to see a black-spotted snowy owl landing gently
on his shoulder.
