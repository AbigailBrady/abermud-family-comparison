I am the Big Boss Man.  I have come here, because I was told there was
cheating going on by Wizards, and Mortals alike.  I have appointed myself
as Judge, Jury, and EXECUTIONER of AberMUD, and promise everyone here
that if you receive help getting points from a Wizard, for no reason,
I will give you a quick and speedy verdict of guilty, and a fair execution.
