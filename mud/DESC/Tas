Tas doesn't seem particulay quiet...In fact you quickly grow bored of
his 'all-time-present-chatting'. You have a feeling you would do everone
a favor by hitting him hard on his skull with 'something that HURTS'.
On second thought, however, why do it? Except from his babbeling you can't
help but kind of like him... Could be a friend in hard times too.
You deside against it (hitting him with something hard I mean)...
Something tells you that his eyes doesn't miss anything...so beware!
