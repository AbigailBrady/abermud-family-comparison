Cathy is a very tall woman, standing over six foot, with dark blonde
hair and blue eyes. She is wearing old, battered boots, old jeans and
worn, but clean, tunic. She look very Saxon, which is her heritage,
and probably has a temper to match. But most of the time she is very
nice (or tries to be).
