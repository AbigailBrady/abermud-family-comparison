You see before you a bright orange and red individual 
dressed in an asbestos flight suit and dark sunglasses.  He greets
you with a cheery grin and a deafening "oohrah."  As he comes closer
you catch a whiff of his cologne--a Texaco special, $1.31 per gallon.
Your eyes drop to the glittering silver wings on his left breast.  
Beneath them, you recognize a Southeast Asia campaign ribbon.  As
he passes, your eyes drift to the patch on his right shoulder:
"I stick to kids!"
