It is obvious that this orc takes his job seriously.  Of course, almost all
orcs take the job of killing others very seriously, so that doesn't mean much.
It appears that he still has blood from his last few kills splattered over
his uniform.  The uniform itself is something to see, with odd chewed bones
which look almost human sticking out of torn, stained pockets.  All in all,
this guy looks like a somewhat unsavory individual.
