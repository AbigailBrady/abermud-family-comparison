Ender is a young man, about fourteen or fifteen.  You notice, however,
that his eyes are old, as old as the stars.  Clearly he has seen many
things in his young life which he should never have seen.  His shoulders
are bent, as though he carries a heavy load, and you wonder what it is
that makes such a boy so old.
