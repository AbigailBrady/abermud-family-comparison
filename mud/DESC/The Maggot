Imagine a grain of rice, blown up to 5 meters in length.  Now imagine that
you dip this grain of rice in unflavored gelatin, so that it becomes slick,
oozy, and slimy.  Rub grime and dirt into the gelatin, and stick on a few
pieces of choice rotting garbage.  Now make a few cosmetic changes to the
rice, such as segmenting it and adding an absolutely hideous mouth.  The
creature you are now visualizing is the much more attractive sister of the
one you're actually looking at.
