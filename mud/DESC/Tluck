   Tluck's face cannot be made out from behind the flowing black robe he
is dressed in.  The robe extends from the hood clear down to the ankles
and terminates just short of the floor, where one can notice the soft
black leather boots covering his feet.  At waist height is a black cloth
belt with several loops that can be adjusted to carry almost any weapon
or object.  The front center of the robe is covered with large runes of
unknown origin.  All in all, he seems quite inward drawn and removed from
what exists around him.
