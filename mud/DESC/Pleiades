    one word, "nacreous,"
coils in me like a conch, a minaret,
or a question always in the process of being posed.
    my favorite part's 'comme un
immense oiseau de nuit', my bedtimes
moor in that glissando, even
    if i've planned a future
that gives no love affairs
    no berth, a future stuck in its circuit like a sun.
