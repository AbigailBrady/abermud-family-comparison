You feel a cold shudder pass through your body as you glimps 
the man before you. You think you've seen him somewhere before, but
you can't recall where ...
He looks at you and his eyes hold yours. There is something about him
that makes you mwant to ask him questions about who he is wher he is
frin, what kind of chesse does he like. You think he probably likes
cheddar but then you aren't so sure. Possibly BLue cheese, but everyone
seems to like blue cheese without really admitting that they like it so
you say 'no... I think it is swiss.'
He looks at you when you say this, but he does not say anything. You are
embarrased that you said your thoughts outload...outloud not outload.
You wonder what he thinks now, because all of a sudden you said 'no...
 I think it is swiss', but you only stare blankly out across hthe room.
'Ahh excuse me' a voice says to you. You turn sharply not knowing what
to think, but then you realize it doesn't matter what you think so
you don't worry about it anymore.
He says 'Hi.. I am Rallan the Godcrusher ... and I do like swiss cheese.'
