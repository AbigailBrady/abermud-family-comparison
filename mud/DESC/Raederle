You see a rather short woman who appears to be in her late twenties or
early thirties.  She has slightly longer than shoulder length brown
hair which is heavily streaked with grey.  Her eyes are green and tilt
up slightly at the outside corners.  She always seems to be on the 
verge of smiling and a small dimple is visible in her left cheek when
she does.  She is dressed in a simple brown robe and her only adornment
is a crimson and black feather which she wears in her hair.
