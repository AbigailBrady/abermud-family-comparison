Before you stands Dasher, Leader of the infamous Christmas Crew.  When
you look closer, you see that he is covered with blood up to his knees,
and has blood stains all over his brown coat.  Your eyes lift to look at
his great antlers, and you see that tere are body parts of his past victems
hanging out of them.  Upon this sight, you throw-up, and clear the way so
you will not join the many others wich he has trampled in the past.
