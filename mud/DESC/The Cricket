On the ground you see a cave cricket chirping peacefully.  As you reach for it
it hops out of your reach:  it is too fast for you.  The cricket's song reminds
you of a clear summer's night when all the stars in the sky can be seen and a
cool summer's breeze can be felt blowing on your face and through your hair. 
As you stand pondering this memory, the cricket notices your presence and 
becomes slient and all becomes quiet.
