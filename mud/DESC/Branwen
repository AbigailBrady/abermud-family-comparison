 Branwen has long golden brown hair pulled back in a thick pony tail that
 comes about halfway down her back.  Although quite beautiful, she dresses
 quietly, as if not sure of her place, or even aware of her beauty.  She
 wears brown colored walking pants, and has a green cloak pulled tightly
 about her.  As you look into her eyes, you sense a great power, but she
 averts her glance before you can put a finger on it.  She carries a small
 harp slung behind her back, which she will, on occasion, pull out and play.
