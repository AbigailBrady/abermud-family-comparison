Carneggy is a tall (6'4"), slender fellow whose shoulder-length black hair is
held back in a ponytail by a scarlet ribbon.  He looks at you with a merry
twinkle in his green eyes that makes you suspect that he is a shameless flirt.
He is wearing a steel, knobbed ring on his right hand, and a leather cord is
wound around his left wrist.  He is clad simply, wearing jeans, and a white
oxford shirt.  He has jackboots on his feet, and is also wearing an old, faded
tuxedo jacket with tails.
