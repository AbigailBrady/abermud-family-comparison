The Wastelands
   You are in what appears to be the last remnants of IthilMUD.  The ground
and landscape is blackened and scorched by the attack of the fearsome beast
called the SysAdmin and there is absolutely nothing left worth taking in the
wreckage.
Edheler The Deposed God is forlornly standing here carrying:
        3.5" Floppy
            The 3.5" Floppy contains:
                IthilMUD (AberMUD 4.99.2)
