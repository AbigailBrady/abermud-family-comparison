You are looking at a person with jet-black hair and sapphire-blue
eyes.  From  the faded color of his hat to the worn-out condition
of his clothes you can see that he has  been  through  more  than
sun   and   rain.  Over his shoulder he wears a shoulder bag, and
barely visible under his jacket you see a strange little circular
device  with  blinking  lights  clipped to his belt.  Stargazer's
overall appearance and his features remind  you  very much of the
famous archaeologist, Indiana Jones.
