Emerald is a proud mage, who towers above most of his peers.  This may
be a result of his elevator shoes, but you're not supps[Dosed to know about
them.  He is a kind man, and would much rather help you than hinder.
However, he dislikes players picking on other players, and will sometimes
be seen killing bullies cruelly.  He is handsome, most certainly, and
doesn't hold it against anyone.  *smile*
