Rockshaper has laughing grayish eyes, brown hair, and a short brown beard.
He seems as if he would be equally at home on the deck of a ship in a gale
or deep beneath the surface of the earth, quarrying stone.  He is always
smiling and chuckling softly.  Other than that, there is nothing out of the
ordinary about his appearance... except that he is nearly 5 meters tall.
