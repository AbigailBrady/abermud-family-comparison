Brandy reminds you of Loni Anderson.  There is a definite resemblance, except
maybe for the fact that Brandy has straggly black hair instead of full blond
hair.  Oh, and Brandy's eyes are crossed and bloodshot.  Brandy is also too
scrawny and underdeveloped to be considered to have an attractive body, or even
a normal body.  Also, Loni uses much better posture, and doesn't usually look
like she's going to attack you just for the hell of it.  Otherwise, though, the
resemblance is amazing.
